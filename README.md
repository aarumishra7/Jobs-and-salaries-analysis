# Salary Insights: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project aims to provide insights into salary distributions and variations across different job categories, locations, and experience levels through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By analyzing a dataset of job listings and salaries, we uncover trends and patterns to better understand the factors influencing salaries in the job market.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis can be found [here](link_to_dataset). It contains detailed information about job titles, salaries in USD, employee residence, experience levels, employment types, work settings, company locations, company sizes, and salary currencies.

## Analysis
The analysis involves various visualizations generated using Python and libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. Key visualizations include:

- **Salary Distribution Across Job Titles**: Bar chart showing median salaries for different job titles.
- **Geographical Salary Differences**: Bar chart illustrating median salaries across employee residences.
- **Salary Distribution Across Experience Levels**: Bar chart displaying median salaries for different experience levels.
- **Salary Distribution Across Employment Types**: Bar chart representing median salaries for various employment types.
- **Salary Variation Across Company Locations**: Bar chart showcasing median salaries across different company locations.
- **Salary Trend Over the Years**: Line chart depicting the median salary trend over the years for different job categories.
